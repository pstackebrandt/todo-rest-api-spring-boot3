# application.properties
# ----------------------   

# This file is used by Spring Boot to configure the runtime behavior 
# of your application. 
# It contains settings such as logging levels, port numbers, 
# database configurations, and other application-specific properties. 
# During the build process (via tasks like processResources), 
# placeholders in this file can be replaced with values defined in
# gradle.properties or elsewhere, making it easier to maintain
# consistency between build-time and runtime configurations.

# profile-specific properties
# Spring Boot provides built-in support for profiles. This means you 
# can create profile-specific configurations such as 
# application-dev.properties, application-prod.properties, etc.
# When a particular profile is active (using the spring.profiles.active 
# property), Spring Boot automatically loads the appropriate configuration
# file. 

# The following properties are placeholders that will be replaced by Gradle during the build.
# They pull values from gradle.properties or the project configuration.

# The project.version property defines the version of the project.
project.version=${project.version}

# The project.name property defines the name of the project.
project.name=${project.name}

# The project.description property defines the description of the project.
project.description=${project.description}  

# Logging configuration
logging.level.root=INFO
logging.level.com.example.todo=DEBUG
logging.pattern.console=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n
